## How To Dowload?
there are **2** ways to dowload the [Spam-Machine](https://github.com/AProXD/Spam-Machine "SPAM-MACHINE GITHUB PAGE")

### the "Easy" Way
  you can dowload the **Spam-Machine** by going into the ["Chat" Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YCN3qK78Rv "discord server"), Then going to the **#chat** text channel, checking pinned messages and then dowloading the `.zip` file which includes The `.exe` and the resources needed for the program to work. (it also includes the .jar)
  
  _(this method of dowloading will change in the future, I'll probably find a more efficient way of doing it)_        

### the "Hard" Way
  **you will need java to do this**
  
  you can dowload the source code via github by going to [https://github.com/AProXD/Spam-Machine](https://github.com/AProXD/Spam-Machine) then pressing **\[code]** --> **\[dowload zip]**. after you save the `.zip` file you would need to export it by using [winrar](https://www.winrar.es/descargas) or any other similar software.
after that you should open the exported folder, Then open the **Spam-Machine-main** folder, open the **Spam-Machine** folder and then copy the file address.

once you've copied the address you can open the **Command Promt** and type 
```cd file/adress ``` it should look something like this: 
```cd C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Spam-Machine-main\Spam-Machine-main\Spam-Machine``` 
after that you would need to compile the [Spam-Machine](https://github.com/AProXD/Spam-Machine "SPAM-MACHINE GITHUB PAGE") by typing:
```javac SpamMachine.java```
if You check the **Spam-Machine** folder you will see that there are now a bunch of `.class` files, That means that the compiling worked.
